# LionFire.Core

Ambitious set of mini-frameworks being developed for other LionFire packages, mostly targeting .NET 7.0+ (with some deprecated parts in .NET Framework 4.8 and netstandard2.0.)  I plan to drop .NET 7 for 8 once one of my needs for .NET 7 disappears, (Spotware cTrader).

# Roadmap

I am fleshing all this out for my own purposes as I need to and am inclined to, with the goal of creating components and frameworks that are useful in the long term.  While I intend for the frameworks and libraries to be decoupled, they may share some common interfaces that hopefully raise the lowest common denominator from the BCL, making some patterns possible that I intend to use heavily, such as multi-typing.

If you find a certain part interesting and want to help advance it into a first class library or framework, let me know.
